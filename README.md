I was born and raised in South Korea. I came to here for graduate study. My current research interests lie in *international institutions*, *global governance*, and *the role of international norms*. 

My hobbies include:
* Yoga and meditation
* Reading novels and essays
* Searching new, groovy music via Spotify
* listening to my playlists in Youtube

I'd like to share one of my favorite music with you guys
